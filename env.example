# This file shows the environment variables that would be needed if you
# were to use server-side API calls instead of client-side configuration.
# The current implementation uses localStorage for credential storage.

# If you want to implement server-side API calls, you can use these:

# GitHub API
# GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-personal-access-token

# Note: The current implementation asks users to configure their own
# credentials through the settings UI, which are stored in localStorage.
